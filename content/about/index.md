I'm Nicholas Pung, a full-stack software developer who dabbles with nutrition and philosophy.

I aim to build applications that are useful for myself and for others who have the same idea as me.

I work as a full-time web developer at Vegas.com and studying computer science fundamentals.

### Future project ideas include:

- An Anki clone written in Javascript that also includes a studying feature
- Displaying a personal dashboard to an E -Ink display
- Automatic Farm
- Nutrition and health app
- Integrating a Pomodoro style timer into Habit Tracker
