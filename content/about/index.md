I'm Nicholas Pung, a full-stack software developer who dabbles with nutrition and philosophy.
I aim to build applications that are useful for myself and others while being highly usable and highly actionable for the user.

I work as a Software Engineer Intern at Blueberry Medical, a Y Combinator funded startup. On my downtime, I work on my personal project: [Productivity Hub](/blog/productivity-hub).
