Before deciding to put all my focus into becoming a Web Developer, I was fortunate enough to work under [Tom Bilyeu from Impact Theory](https://www.youtube.com/tombilyeu), where I learned and ingrained in my head that developing skills is one of the most important aspects in life to provide value to others.

So when Impact Theory decided to join the comic book industry, we had to get a list of comic book retailers so that we could sell our comic books to them. To save some costs, I decided to use Python and Google Maps API to create an address scraper to grab all comic book retail store addresses. After building the address scraper, I remembered my old passion in learning how to code, and decided to pursue becoming a Software Developer full time in late April 2019.
