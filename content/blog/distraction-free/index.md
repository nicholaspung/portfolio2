description: "I spent a lot of time distracting myself by looking at Reddit for certain posts. Because of how much time I spend with that on my time, I set out to create an application that would minimize that urge, while also learning new technologies. Although this application would have been extremely easy using React, I decided to use different technologies and make the scope of the project more project in order to learn. In doing so, I learned the basics of working with Vue, Auth0, and using a Cron scheduler. "

## Background

One day, I found myself thinking about checking Reddit more and more during my time off, when my goal was to practice creating projects. It came to the point where I checked Reddit over 100x that day (I'm exaggerating, but still.) Because of this realization, I knew I had to curb that urge by creating a project I had built in the past, a Reddit Tracker. However, I knew this would be an easy project to do in React, as I had built one after programming for only 2 months, I wanted to challenge myself in learning something new. I previously tried creating an API that would do this exact thing, but I didn't follow through with the project. Because of that, I knew I wanted to create an API, even if it was overkill for the scope of the project. On the frontend, I wanted to try a different technology since I learned web development through learning React and also because I heard great things about building with Vue.

## What I Did

I chose to create the project using Vue and Node. For authenticatiion, I didn't want to manage dealing with user sensitive information, so I chose Auth0 since I had previously used Firebase Auth.
