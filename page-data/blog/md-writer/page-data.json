From listening to Sivers talk about programming, he mentioned that he loved to save everything in text files on his computers for notes/articles/books. Inspired by this, I decided to create a lightweight text editor that rendered markdown while you write. I chose markdown because even if it becomes unsupported, there’s little difference between .txt files and .md files. I chose Electron because it would be a different technology I hadn’t learned yet, and also because I didn’t want to waste extra time learning a different programming language to build a desktop application.</p>\n<h2>What I Did</h2>\n<p>I started off looking for Electron templates to make my development process easier. After searching for a while, I realized that most templates seem to be carrying a lot of bloatware that I wouldn’t be taking advantage of because of how small the features would be. So in the end, I took <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\">electron-quick-start</a> and started there.</p>\n<p>In the beginning, I searched for ways to add React to the project since I wanted to finish the project ASAP, but couldn’t find a good enough tutorial to follow. Instead, I decided to use regular Javascript to get used to manipulating the DOM manually and to see how different it would be to create a simple application without a framework.</p>\n<h2>Reflections</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Code modularization is still important even if you create a very small project. Logic gets mixed up as the complexity of the application grows and when you start mixing up different functionality in the same function.</li>\n<li>Functional programming seems to be important when creating functionality that is reused, but not the way that functional programming is taught. Whenever I found myself reusing some logic, I would modify it to be “idempotent” in a function so that I wouldn’t be confused by what the function does. Of course, I use “idempotent” in quotes because some functions modify the DOM, and others send processes to Electron, which are both side-effects.</li>\n<li>Use JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() to create a .txt based “database.” Because these operations are pretty fast in Node, it’s easier to transform between the two data types, rather than modifying a .txt file directly and creating unnecessary complex logic to keep track of data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Learnings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Modularize code in the beginning, even if the application is small.</li>\n<li>Try to make your code follow functional programming concepts, with minimal side-effects.</li>\n<li>Use language-specific ways to make your life easier when dealing with unconventional use cases. For example, transform arrays and objects to strings with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() when dealing with make-shift databases, just like how you would when using localStorage on the browser.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"MD Writer | Case Study","date":"May 20, 2020","description":"Inspired by Derek Sivers, I decided to create a lightweight text editor that rendered markdown while you write that would only rely on your OS.
