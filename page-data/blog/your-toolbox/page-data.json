If you want to grab a whole bunch of data together to display, there’s a lot of prop-drilling that would not be necessary if using something like Redux.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Learnings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring takes a lot of time.</li>\n<li>Build an application with architecture in mind first. Thinking you can change your architecture while building your application will give you a bad time and make you spend a lot more time on the project than you wanted.</li>\n<li>Using Firebase for both authentication and database is easy. Using a NoSQL database for an application meant to use a SQL database makes logic rather difficult. Make sure you are using the right kind of database rather than what technology you want to use.</li>\n<li>Deciding between React Context API and Redux will depend on how big your application is and what you decide to do with it.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Your Toolbox | Case Study","date":"April 20, 2020","description":"I had been using Habitica as my habit tracker for quite some time, but I got sick of the extra pop-ups and gaming aspects of the application as I didn't use those features.
